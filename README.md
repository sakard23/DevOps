```Your mind is like a RAM, not like a storage. So keep a habit of keeping journal of everything that you did.```
```Think your employer as your customer for your business. This perspective moves you from a position of powerlessness and dependency on your employer to self-direction. Switch the mindset from company's servant to that of business person who's running business and expanding the brand.```

# IT Major roles (2023 verion)
There are 6 major IT jobs that are in high demands in the current (2023) market. These are:
- Software Engineer: (Entry level role)
    - To learn coding:
        - Learn foundational (loop, conditional, function, method, data types)
        - Learn syntax
        - Get the full picture, and try to link line between your tasks.
        - Focus on how far you've come
        - Learn to understand other people's code
        - Learn from Documentation for their respective Documentation website
        - Ask questions as many as you have
        - Take time to learn anything, which will make deep foundation
        - Try to make pseudocode prior to starting any tasks
        - While learning, never compare your skills with others, but always compare your current skills to your old-self.

- Need to know services equivalence to on-premises
- Should have experience on migrating on-premises applications and services to cloud
### ```Important Cloud Tools to focus on: Linux,Networking,Bash,Python,AWS,Terraform```


## DevOps Engineer (Releasing software applications faster)
###### Coding --> CI/CD --> Servers
```Software Development LifeCycle (Plan->Code->Build->Test->Release->Deploy->Operate->Monitor)```
- Agile, Scrum, SAFe methodology
- Cloud services:
    - AWS 
    - Azure
##### Dev part: (Plan->Code->Build->Test)
- Basics of Software Development (Python, Ruby, JAVA)
- Version control (Git, Gitlabs, Github)
##### Ops part: (Release->Deploy->Operate->Monitor)
- OS and Linux Basics:
    - Linux File System
    - Linux File Permissions
    - Server Mgmt
    - SSH Key Mgmt
    - SSH into server
- Virtualization (VMs)
- Security:
    - Firewall configuration to secure access
    - Proxy servers
- Networking:
    - Load Balancers
    - HTTP/HTTPS
    - IP address
    - Ports
    - DNS
- Containers: A container is a standard unit of software that pkgs up code and all its dependencies so the app runs quickly and reliably on any computing environment.
    - Docker:
        - Run Containers
        - Inspect active containers
        - Docker Networking
        - Persist data with Docker volumns
        - Dockerize apps using Dockerfiles
        - Run multiple containers using Docker-Compose
        - Work with Docker Repository
```VMs virtualize the whole OS. Containers virtualize only the application level of the OS.```
- Container Orchestration (K8s)
##### CI/CD part:
- CI/CD tool (Jenkins)
- Monitoring experience (Splunk)
- Scripting language (Python, Bash)
- Infrastructure as Code, IaC (Terraform->infrastructure provisioning tool, (Ansible, Puppet,Chef)->configuration mgmt tools)

### ```Important DevOps Tools to focus on: Linux,Git,Docker,K8s,Jenkins,AWS,Terraform,EKS,Python,Ansible,Splunk```

### Notes: Before jumping into any tools/apps:
- Try to understand concepts before learning the tools.
- What problems does this tool is solving?
- Where the tools' solutions fits in the bigger picture of the end-to-end software dev lifecycle?
- How the tool solves the problems?
