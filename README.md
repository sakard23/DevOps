# IT Major roles (2023 verion)
There are 6 major IT jobs that are in high demands in the current (2023) market. These are:
- Software Engineer (Entry level role)
- DevOps Engineer (Intermediate role - needs some knowledge on Networking, SysAdmin, Software Development LifeCycle knowledge)
- Cloud Engineer (Beginner role - can start with basic Linux, OS, Cloud certification knowledge)
- Cyber Security Engineer (Intermediate role - needs some Cloud, Networking, SysAdmin, Software Development LifeCycle knowledge)
- Big Data Engineer (Data Analyst- Entry level job, Data Engineer - INtermediate level job, Data Scientist - Advanced level job)
- Machine Learning Engineer (Advanced level job)

## System Administration
- Set up infrastructure
- Configure and prepare for deployment
- Work with OS
- Install and configure software
- Configure Networking
- Configure Security through Firewalls
- Storage backups
- Database Admin
- Network Admin
- Security Admin


## Cloud Engineer (Create Reliable and Secure Cloud infrastructre)
- To be a cloud engineer, you need to know one cloud service providers, AWS, Azure or Google.
- Need to know services equivalence to on-premises
- Should have experience on migrating on-premises applications and services to cloud
### ```Important Cloud Tools to focus on: Linux,Networking,Bash,Python,AWS,Terraform```


## DevOps Engineer (Releasing software applications faster)
###### Coding --> CI/CD --> Servers
```Software Development LifeCycle (Plan->Code->Build->Test->Release->Deploy->Operate->Monitor)```
- Agile, Scrum, SAFe methodology
- Cloud services:
    - AWS 
    - Azure
##### Dev part: (Plan->Code->Build->Test)
- Basics of Software Development (Python, Ruby, JAVA)
- Version control (Git, Gitlabs, Github)
##### Ops part: (Release->Deploy->Operate->Monitor)
- OS and Linux Basics:
    - Linux File System
    - Linux File Permissions
    - Server Mgmt
    - SSH Key Mgmt
    - SSH into server
- Virtualization (VMs)
- Security:
    - Firewall configuration to secure access
    - Proxy servers
- Networking:
    - Load Balancers
    - HTTP/HTTPS
    - IP address
    - Ports
    - DNS
- Containers: A container is a standard unit of software that pkgs up code and all its dependencies so the app runs quickly and reliably on any computing environment.
    - Docker:
        - Run Containers
        - Inspect active containers
        - Docker Networking
        - Persist data with Docker volumns
        - Dockerize apps using Dockerfiles
        - Run multiple containers using Docker-Compose
        - Work with Docker Repository
```VMs virtualize the whole OS. Containers virtualize only the application level of the OS.```
- Container Orchestration (K8s)
##### CI/CD part:
- CI/CD tool (Jenkins)
- Monitoring experience (Splunk)
- Scripting language (Python, Bash)
- Infrastructure as Code, IaC (Terraform->infrastructure provisioning tool, (Ansible, Puppet,Chef)->configuration mgmt tools)

### ```Important DevOps Tools to focus on: Linux,Git,Docker,K8s,Jenkins,AWS,Terraform,EKS,Python,Ansible```

### Notes: Before jumping into any tools/apps:
- Try to understand concepts before learning the tools.
- What problems does this tool is solving?
- Where the tools' solutions fits in the bigger picture of the end-to-end software dev lifecycle?
- How the tool solves the problems?
